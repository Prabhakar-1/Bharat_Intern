# Wine Quality and House Price Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting wine quality and house prices using linear regression models. The project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.pyplot for data manipulation, model development, and visualization.

## Wine Quality Prediction

- **Description**: The code splits a dataset containing information about white wine into training and testing sets. It then applies Linear Regression to predict wine quality and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). A scatter plot visualizes the predicted vs. actual wine quality, providing a clear representation of the regression and model accuracy.

## House Price Prediction

- **Description**: This script generates synthetic housing data with house size and price related by a linear equation plus noise. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is initialized and trained on the training data. The trained model is used to predict house prices, and the prediction quality is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The script visualizes the results through a scatter plot depicting actual vs. predicted house prices, highlighting the accuracy of the prediction model.

## Usage
