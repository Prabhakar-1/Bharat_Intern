wine quality prediction-Utilizing numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot, this code splits a white wine dataset, applies LinearRegression for quality prediction, and evaluates via MSE. A scatter plot visualizes predicted vs. actual quality, succinctly presenting regression and visualization.
house price prediction-It generates synthetic housing data with house size and price related by a linear equation plus noise. The dataset splits into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is initiated, trained on the training data, and used for predicting house prices. Mean Squared Error evaluates the prediction quality. The script visualizes results through a scatter plot depicting actual vs. predicted house prices. This succinct script highlights synthetic data generation, model training, prediction, MSE assessment, and visualization of housing price prediction.
